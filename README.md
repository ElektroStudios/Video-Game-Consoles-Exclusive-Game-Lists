## 👋 Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a point of reference with the following Markdown files provided through the tables below to easily find and identify which games were released exclusively for a specific platform, and which were not.

Note: GitHub will not render Markdown files that are considered too big, so I'll recommend you to use the fast and open-sorce program [Markdown Viewer](https://github.com/c3er/mdview) if you require to view some of these Markdown files offline.
